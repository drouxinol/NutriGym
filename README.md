# NutriGym
 
Overview

This project is a mobile application developed using React Native, created to gain hands-on experience and practice with the language and its ecosystem. The app is designed to help users manage their fitness routines by allowing them to create workout plans and add exercises to these plans. It leverages modern React Native features such as hooks and AsyncStorage for efficient state management and data persistence.

Features

    Workout Plans Management:
        - Users can create multiple workout plans tailored to their fitness goals.
        - Each plan can have various exercises added to it, allowing for a customized workout routine.!


    Data Persistence:
        - Utilizes AsyncStorage to save workout plans and exercises locally on the device, ensuring that user data is retained between app sessions.

Future Development

    Nutrition Section:
        - There are plans to develop a Nutrition section in the future. This feature will further enhance the app by allowing users to track their dietary intake and manage their nutrition alongside their workout routines.
        - This addition will serve as an opportunity to gain more practice with React Native and possibly integrate new technologies and libraries.
